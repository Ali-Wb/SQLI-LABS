# SQLI-LABS

# Introduction:


**SQLI labs to test error based, Blind boolean based, Time based.**

**Structured Query Language**, also known as **SQL**, is basically a programming language that deals with databases.
For beginners, databases are simply data stores that contain both **client side** and **server side** data. **SQL** manages databases through structured queries, relations, object oriented programming, etc.

Programming geeks will have come across many such types of software, like **MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, and Postgresql**.
These are a few of the programs that give us the capability to manage large databases/data stores through **structured queries**.

The lab we will be using for demonstration is SQLi Labs, which can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Audi-1/sqli-labs solely for the purpose of studying and making applications safe from such vulnerabilities.

**SQLI-LABS is my attempt to explain the basics involved in SQL injections.**

**SQLI-LABS is a platform to learn SQLI Following labs are covered for GET and POST scenarios:**

1. Error Based Injections (Union Select)
  
      i. String\
      ii. Integer
  
2. Error Based Injections (Double Injection Based)

3. BLIND Injections: 

   i. Boolian Based 
   
   ii. Time Based

4. Update Query Injection 

5. Insert Query Injections 

6. Header Injections. 

    i. Referer based
    
    ii. UserAgent based
    
    iii. Cookie based
